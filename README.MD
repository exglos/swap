# exglos swap

## abstract

**Exglos swap** aims to leverage existing decentralized contracts, focusing on a design ethos that prioritizes blockchain's foundational principles: **trustlessness, permissionlessness, and censorship resistance**. While many contracts uphold these principles, current user interfaces often fall short in effectively aligning with them.

## goals

The main goal of the exglos swap project is to improve user interaction with decentralized finance by creating an easy-to-use interface that connects with existing swap contracts, all while upholding the **do your own research** principle and allowing users to make their own choices without any manipulation.

## roadmap

1. **Build a minimum viable product**: Develop a simple interface for users to buy and sell any existing token using top decentralized contracts.
2. **Gather feedback**: Collect user feedback and prioritize the next steps for development.
3. **Add functionality**: Implement features such as customizable swap parameters and routing options.
4. **Integrate with exglos wallet**: Combine the swap interface with the exglos wallet for a seamless user experience.
